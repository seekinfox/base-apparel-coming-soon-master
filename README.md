## My process
  - plan a design structure 
  - build structure with html
  - use outline and style them without content or use text to get a idea. 
  - add content and adjust style
  - write a function to verify email
  - adjust some small details.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- javaScript
- DOM

### What I learned

The challenge was unexpectedly challenging in terms of layout.
I have made some silly errors in creating this layout but, it works for now.
It solidified my relative and fixed units understanding.
Creating a function to verify a email and using dom was a good practice.
I will build  more mini-javascript projects.
